1. No need to restrict eta. Just choose \eta * A = H^-1. -1pts.

3. Missing square in final expression. -1pts.

3) 

1. Not the right final expression. -2pts.

3+4. Use I and not 1 when dealing with metrices and vectors (it's not a scalar). -1pts.

5. Not accurate, see solution. -1pts.

4)

4. You need to differ between step size and numerical precision, you should have used the step size as recommended in lecture h=(1+max_i(|x_i|)\sqrt(\epslion). See the solution. -2pts.

5. Not the properties we look into (inputs and outputs # considrations, storing values memory of back prop and so on...). -2pts.
